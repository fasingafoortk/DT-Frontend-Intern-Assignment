DT Frontend Intern Assignment

This repository contains the submission for the Frontend Intern task required by DeepThought.

📌 Features
✔ Responsive layout using HTML & CSS  
✔ Dynamic data loading from JSON  
✔ Interactive UI with JavaScript

🧠 Thought Process
I separated UI structure (HTML), styling (CSS), and data logic (JS). The page loads card content from a JSON file and displays it dynamically, similar to real frontend work with APIs.

 📁 Files
- `index.html` – main page
- `style.css` – styling
- `script.js` – application logic
- `data.json` – data source

📌 How to View
Open `index.html` in a browser.  
No build tools required.
